# Road Accident Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify key factors influencing accident severity and frequency. It aims to provide insights that can help in improving road safety measures.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Accident prediction data for India.
- **Features:** State Name, City Name, Year, Month, Time of Day, Accident Severity, Vehicle Type, Road Condition, and more.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing trends and identifying patterns in accident data.
4. **Insights and Conclusions:** Deriving key findings and safety recommendations.

## Key Findings
- Most accidents occur during the night.
- Two-wheelers are involved in the highest number of accidents.
- Poor road conditions significantly increase accident severity.

##  How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis.
